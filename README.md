# GPGPU Performance Test: CPU vs GPU with OpenCL and MSYS2 ⚙️

Are you looking to compare the computing power of your CPU against your GPU? Here’s a simple yet powerful test you can run using OpenCL and MSYS2 to compare the performance of both devices.

## Why OpenCL and MSYS2?

    OpenCL is a powerful framework for running parallel computations on a variety of devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators.

    MSYS2 is a development environment for Windows that makes installing and managing software packages easy, including those for development with OpenCL.

## What Does the Script Do?

The script I’ve developed allows you to:

    Compile and run a program that adds two vectors (a simple yet computation-intensive task).

    Compare execution times between the CPU and GPU, clearly showing the performance difference.

    Optimize hardware resource usage, leveraging the power of the GPU for parallel operations.

## How Easy Is It to Use?

Just run a bash script on MSYS2, choose whether to build, run, or clean up, and compare the results! Here's an example of usage:

    Build: ./opencl_vs_cpu_avg.sh build

    Run: ./opencl_vs_cpu_avg.sh run

    Clean: ./opencl_vs_cpu_avg.sh clean

## The Benefits:

    Instantly get the results of the test, with execution times for both CPU and GPU.

    Easy to adapt for other parallel computation tests.

    No complexity in setup—just MSYS2 and your hardware!

## Why Should You Try It?

Harnessing the power of your GPU for parallel operations can drastically speed up computations compared to traditional CPU processing, especially for tasks like machine learning, simulations, and 3D graphics. This test will give you an immediate sense of how your setup handles parallel tasks.
